# Xero API Integration for Account Chart in Django

This document explains the steps involved in integrating the Xero API to fetch and display account chart data in a Django application. It covers the setup process, the flow of data, and the interaction between the Django backend and Xero API.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Xero API into a Django application and display account charts. The Xero API provides access to accounting data, and we fetch account data from the API, process it, and render it on a webpage. This guide outlines how the data flows in the application.

---

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 5.x or higher
- A valid [Xero Developer Account](https://developer.xero.com/) with API access
- Xero OAuth credentials (client ID, client secret, and API scopes)

### Install Dependencies

Ensure all the necessary dependencies are installed by running the command to install requirements from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Configure Xero Credentials

Add your Xero credentials (client ID, client secret, and other necessary configurations) in the `settings.py` file. These credentials are used to authenticate requests to the Xero API.

## Code Flow

### Fetching Data from Xero API

1. **OAuth Token Validation:**
   - The application checks if a valid OAuth token exists in the database. If the token is expired, it refreshes the token using the stored refresh token.
   - A helper function verifies the token's expiration and handles the token refresh process by making a request to the Xero OAuth token endpoint.

2. **Making the Request:**
   - With a valid OAuth token, the application makes a GET request to the Xero API endpoint for accounts.
   - The request includes the access token in the `Authorization` header to ensure the request is authenticated.

### Processing the Data

1. **Parsing the Response:**
   - The response from Xero is a JSON object containing an array of accounts under the `"Accounts"` key. Each account includes fields like `AccountID`, `Code`, `Name`, and `Type`.
   - The relevant data is extracted and formatted into a list of dictionaries for easier handling.

2. **Handling Missing or Empty Accounts:**
   - If the `"Accounts"` field is empty or missing, the application gracefully handles this by passing an empty list or a relevant message to the template.

### Rendering the Data in the Template

- The processed account data is passed to the `account_chart.html` template for rendering.
- The template displays the account data in a table format, with each row showing the account code, name, and type.
- If no accounts are available, a message is displayed indicating that no data was found.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Invalid or Expired Token:**
   - Ensure that the OAuth token is correctly refreshed when expired. Verify the token's validity in the database.

2. **API Request Issues:**
   - If the API request fails, check the response status code and error message for details.
   - Ensure that your Xero credentials are correct and that you have the necessary permissions/scopes for the requested data.

3. **No Data:**
   - If no accounts are returned, verify that the API response contains valid account data under the `"Accounts"` key.
